# ContactsToCalendar

## Overview

Takes in a contact file (.vcf) and generates a calendar file (.ics) containing a yearly event for each contact with a birthday.

## Purpose

If your contacts and calendar services aren't part of the same ecosystem it can be difficult to get them to sync with one another. And, even if they are, you are typically limited in terms of how you might want to customize those events. This aims to solve those problems.

## Directions

1. Export your contacts. You may need to use your contact app's web client to do so (Hint: If you are using iCloud Contacts, press Control+A to select all of your contacts prior to exporting).
2. Use setup.exe to install the program.
3. Run the program; it will ask for the full path to a .ics file.
4. Paste or type the full path to the contacts file you exported. It should look like something along the lines of "C:\Users\username\Downloads\ContactsExport.vcf", without the quotes.
5. The calendar file will be generated and placed in the same directory.
6. In your calendar app, create a separate calendar within your main calendar called "Birthdays". Customize the default reminders/notifications however you please. I use the following notifications, but customize this however you like:
  a. Day-of event notification first thing in the morning.
  b. Two days before the event notification so I can get a gift, make plans, travel, or do anything else I might want to do ahead of time.
7. Import the calendar file into your new "Birthdays" calendar.
